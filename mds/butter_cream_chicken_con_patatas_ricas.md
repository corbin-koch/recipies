butter cream chicken con patatas ricas

\

i don't have a blender (or other effective mechanism) in my flat to make
a compote butter, so i've had to look for reasonable substitutes. a
strategy i've discovered that works pretty well is melting butter in a
pan, adding the necessary ingredients to 'compote' the butter, then
putting it in a jar overnight to solidify. i must say, it works decently
well! the only caveat is that it requires some planning as you need
enough time to let the butter solidify prior to use.

edit: i have a blender now

\

with regards to this recipe, i really like how all aspects blend
together at the end in cooking the potatoes in the chicken drippings.
hell, keep the bones and make a broth...fuck round wit it and waste not
- all parts of the chicken are good parts of the chicken.

ingredients:

\

-   chicken (spatchcocked (of course))
-   new potatoes
-   lemon juice
-   flour
-   olive oil
-   3 clove of garlic

\

for the butter/sauce:

\

-   100 g unsalted butter
-   2 shallots
-   2 garlic clove
-   3 anchovy in olive oil
-   1/2 tsp curry powder (medium)
-   1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
-   1 tbsp mustard powder
-   1 tbsp capers
-   \~0.25-0.5 cups of of herbs (parsely, thyme, tarragon, chives or
    anything else)
-   100 ml single or whipping cream
-   2 tsp lemon juice

\

steps:

\

1.  to make the butter, combine the first 7 ingredients into a sauce pan
    on medium heat. as the butter melts, stir everything together until
    the anchovies (and oil) are fully desolved and the shallots have
    softened. once here, add the capers, herbs, salt + pepper and cook
    for another few minutes. set the pan aside (allowing it to cool)
    before adding the creme. if you do not set the pan aside to cool,
    the cream will curdle and you will be sad. after adding the cream,
    add the lemon juice as well, and put the butter-y/sauce mixture in a
    glass jar. refrigerate overnight \[1\].
2.  once the butter has solidified, the rest of the process should be
    fairly quick. preheat the oven to 200C, boil a pot of generously
    salted water and add the baby new potatoes in the boiling water for
    15 minutes. meanwhile, place the chicken on a parchment lined tray
    and, using your index finger/middle finger, separate the skin away
    from the flesh on the breast. do this for both breasts and thighs.
    once separated, take the cold butter compote and stuff it between
    the skin. try to distribute evenly by pressing on the skin/moving
    the butter around underneath. you can add any remaining butter to
    the outside of the chicken and sprinkle with salt and pepper. place
    this in the oven, setting a timer for 25 minutes.
3.  hopefully your potatoes are done by now. strain the water from the
    potatoes, halve them, and add into a large bowl. once in the bowl,
    add the lemon juice, olive oil, crushed garlic salt and pepper.
    after coating, sprinkle the potatoes with flour and continue tossing
    until small bits of the flour consolidate on the halved potatoes.
4.  once the 25 minutes are up on the chicken, baste (or spoon dripping
    over), add the potatoes around the chicken, and return to the oven.
    baste again after 10, and shake the potatoes around. wait for
    another 5-10 minutes then pull out the chicken. if the potatoes look
    delicious, then they're ready, otherwise, let them cook for another
    10 \[2\].
5.  carve the chicken, serve on a platter with the potatoes - or in
    whatever presentation your heart desires.

\[1\] this sauce is awesome to use for other things as well like pasta
or over a steak

\[2\] maybe even salt 'em up a bit (?)
