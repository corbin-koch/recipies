tahini wheat noodles with veg

\

notes:

using leftover vegetables from another night instead of the sweet
potatoes/onions and eggplant is a totally reasonable substitute
(mushrooms and garlic broccoli pan fried in soy sauce also delish) . I
just used this combo because I had it on hand from another night. I
think the special component of this is that it's really easy to make and
is a delish pad-thai-ish nutty sauce.

ingredients:

-   wheat noodle
-   harissa 60g
-   red onion 2 thinly sliced
-   sweet potatoes 1-2 cubed
-   egg plant/abrigine 1 cubed
-   sesame oil
-   ufra chili 2 tsp
-   lime to finish

\

For sauce:

-   tahnini 60g
-   mirin 1.5 tbsp
-   rice vinegar 1.5 tbsp
-   soy sauce 2 tbsp
-   sesame oil 2 tbsp

\

steps:

\

1.  turn the oven to 200C fan and toss the sweet potato with harissa,
    olive oil, salt and pepper while waiting for the oven to heat. place
    on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and put into the oven
    once warm. check on them \~10 minutes in and shake/disturb every
    subsequent \~10 until crisp (\~25-35 min total).
2.  meanwhile heat sesame oil on low/medium on a pan and add the red
    onion/egg plant. you don't want this sizzling but also not just
    wilting on low heat. once the veggies have softened a bit, add the
    ufra chili and continue to cook until they seem right (some light
    cook marks on the veg). the whole process should take \~15-20
    minutes.
3.  boil water and follow the package instructions for the wheat noodles
    (typically \~6-7 minutes then rinse with cold h20).
4.  combine all the ingredients for the sauce into a bowl and whisk
    together to get a semi-consistent sauce. taste and change as
    desired!
5.  in a large bowl, put the noodles, veggies and toss with the sauce.
    serve with lime and sriracha (could even fry some red chilis!)
