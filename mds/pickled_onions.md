pickled onions

\

ingredients:

\

-   apple cider vinegar
-   1 tbsp salt
-   1.5 tbsp sugar
-   one of: harissa, sumac or sriracha[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}
-   1-2 red onion thinly sliced (optional: thinly sliced red chili or
    carrots)

\

steps:

\

1.  in a glass or bowl pour \~1/2 a cup of apple cider vinegar and stir
    in salt and sugar to combine. add either one spoonful of harissa, 1
    tbsp of sumac or one spoonful of
    sriracha.[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}
2.  place the red onions into the glass/bowl and fill with enough water
    to submerge the onions. using luke warm water helps to dissolve and
    spread the vinegar/other ingredients across the onions.
3.  let sit for \~2-3 hours until the onions start to turn a pinkish hue
4.  remove onions from the vinegar mixture and into a jar. you may fill
    the jar \~halfway with vinegar for continued pickling (what I like
    to do).
